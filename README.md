A Cool Game

running locally:

in `/frontend` run the following commands:
`npm install .` (only need to do the first time)
`npm run dev` - this will serve client on https://localhost:8080

in top level dir run the following commands (note you should be on python 3.7):
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
`python manage.py runserver` - this will serve the backend on http://localhost:8000

thats it for now
